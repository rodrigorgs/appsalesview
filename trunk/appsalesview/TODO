BUG:
* [empty]

TODO List:
* Export selection to CSV
* Daily report summary
* Create advanced filtering criteria, including data grouping
  - Partly done. It still lacks a graphical interface
* Run report download in a separate thread and provide hooks in the downloader
* Allow saving filtering criteria
* Allow to download to reports for the same day for two distinct iTunes Connect accounts
* maybe show best rank, if available.

DONE:
* Show yesterday's sales (along with total) in the bottom bar.
* Show money (along with units) in the chart.
* Show info after report download (X reports downloaded...)
* Detect types of downloads (promo code, update, sale, refund)
* Create JPanel for total sales
* [BUG] When selecting both a paid and a free application, the total money becomes 0.0.
* [BUG] Incorrect character encoding (accents show wrong). The bug is while downloading the report. It is originally UTF-8, but it's saved as some strange encoding (maybe iso-8859-1).
* [BUG] Promo codes aren't displayed. SOLVED: Not a bug. You have to choose US as country.
* [BUG] There's need to restart the application in order to see updates
  - [OK] When loading files
  - [OK] When downloading reports
* Remember last item selected when updating form
* Total in money
